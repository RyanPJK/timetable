Online Exercise Time-Table

This is an experiment in creating an web-based weekly exercise time-table.

The idea will be to to the following:

i.  Add the event to my GCALENDAR.
ii.  Send SMS alert on day of event - with option to CONFIRM or CANCEL.
iii.  Count/ Sum classes BOOKED.
iv.  Count/ Sum classes ATTENDED.
v.  Count/ Sum classes CANCELLED.

To Do (no particular order):
TABLE MAIN
i.  SHOW drop-down on HOVER.
ii.  ARROW icon being annoying.
iii.  ARROW UP/ DOWN icon.
iv.  ? Convert all colours to RBGA? - Expect BG.
v.  MQs.
  
TABLE TOTALS
vi.  COUNT/ SUMs...  in JS/ jQ -- equivalent to EXCEL formulas:  {= SUM( COUNTIFS( exercise, tableArray))} and = COUNTIF( tableArray, exercise).
vii.  Add event to calendar.
viii.  SMS alert.
